* Conditions                                                      :condition:
Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can
arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or
other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a
few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is
countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by
the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each
instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's
effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is
subjected to a condition.

** Blinded                                                   :blind:blinded:
- A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check
  that requires sight.
  
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's
  attack rolls have disadvantage.

** Charmed                                                   :charm:charmed:
- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with
  harmful abilities or magical effects.
  
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially
  with the creature.

** Deafened                                                   :deaf:deafend:
- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability
  check that requires hearing.

** Exhaustion                                                   :exhaustion:
Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and
the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to
a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six
levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion,
as specified in the effect's description.

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes
exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount
specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well
as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2
exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the
effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's
exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1,
provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also,
being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.

*** Table: Exhaustion Effects                                       :table:

  a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily

* Pantheons                                          :pantheons:dieties:gods:
The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy
interpretations of historical religions from our world's ancient times.
They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game,
divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into
pantheons that serve the needs of the game.

** The Celtic Pantheon                                              :celtic:
It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space
that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering
wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak-and
it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the
brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and
the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared
put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling
in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.

The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they
are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.

** The Greek Pantheon                                                :greek:
The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves
against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the
cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere,
olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of
nature echoes with their presence, and they've made a place for
themselves inside the human heart, too.

** The Egyptian Pantheon                                          :egyptian:
These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the
rulership of the cosmos and the maintenance of the divine principle of
Ma'at-the fundamental order of truth, justice, law, and order that puts
gods, mortal pharaohs, and ordinary men and women in their logical and
rightful place in the universe.

The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for
death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god
of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic
evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris.
And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.

** The Norse Pantheon                                                :norse:
Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below,
where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow
forward and retreat with every fall and spring-this is the land of the
Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a brutal clime, and one
that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt
to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too
twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of
raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as
well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for
strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in
every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the
booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning
longhouse.

The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war
and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once
enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common
enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).

* Planes                                                       :planes:plane:
The cosmos teems with a multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate
dimensions of reality, called the *planes of existence*. It encompasses
every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively
mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of
raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the
homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.

Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon
the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and
allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater
power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or
test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with
each dawn.

** The Material Plane                                               :mortal:
The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental
forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of
mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within
the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and
adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the
Material Plane.

The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they
reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there,
as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include
magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where
magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless
Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned.

** Beyond the Material                                     :beyond:material:
Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of
myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but different
qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental
principles abstracted from the ordinary world.

*** Planar Travel                                                  :travel:
When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are
undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a
mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a
journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking
out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in
its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.

Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in
two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.

*/Spells/*. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other
planes of existence. [[file:10.spells.org::*Plane Shift][Plane Shift]] and [[file:10.spells.org::*Gate][Gate]] can transport adventurers
directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of
precision. [[file:10.spells.org::*Etherealness][Etherealness]] allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane
and travel from there to any of the planes it touches-such as the
Elemental Planes. And the [[file:10.spells.org::*Astral Projection][Astral Projection]] spell lets adventurers
project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.

*/Portals/*. A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar
connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific
location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or
a fog- shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the
interplanar travel. Others are locations- circles of standing stones,
soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in
multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.
Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very
similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano
(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane
of Water).

*** Transitive Planes                                          :transitive:
The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive
Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways
to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as [[file:10.spells.org::*Etherealness][Etherealness]] and
[[file:10.spells.org::*Astral Projection][Astral Projection]] allow characters to enter these planes and traverse
them to reach the planes beyond.

The *Ethereal Plane* is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes
described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal,
overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location
on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane.
Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the [[file:10.spells.org::*See Invisibility][See Invisibility]]
and [[file:10.spells.org::*True Seeing][True Seeing]] spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend
from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that
use force energy such as [[file:10.spells.org::*Forcecage][Forcecage]] and [[file:10.spells.org::*Wall of Force][Wall of Force]]. The depths of the
plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.

The *Astral Plane* is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors
travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and
demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and below, with
swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light
resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair
like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found here,
but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.

*** Inner Planes                                                    :inner:
The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes,
providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were
made. The four *Elemental Planes* - Air, Earth, Fire, and Water - form a
ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning *Elemental
Chaos*.

At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane
(in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four
Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four
elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land,
sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental
Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their
purest form-great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear
water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when
discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just
the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure
elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing
energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.

*** Outer Planes                                                    :outer:
If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the
multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for
such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as
divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes
are best known as the homes of deities.

When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be
highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally "places" at
all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought
and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the
perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while
extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.

Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive.
Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to
natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims
of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the
mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely,
effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill
their own needs.

Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The
perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can
also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to
take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth,
in a single day-if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take
weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.

The most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that
correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades
of distinction between them.

**** Outer Planes
The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the
*Upper Planes*. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in
the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the *Lower
Planes*. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A
plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment
doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance
there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good
Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature
feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.

**** Demiplanes
Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique
rules. They are pieces of reality that don't seem to fit anywhere else.
Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by
spells, such as [[file:10.spells.org::*Demiplane][Demiplane]], or generated at the desire of a powerful
deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing
reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as
a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered
through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a
[[file:10.spells.org::*Plane Shift][Plane Shift]] spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the
proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to
acquire. The [[file:10.spells.org::*Gate][Gate]] spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of
the demiplane.

* Situational Rules                                  :rule:rules:situational:
** Traps                                                        :trap:traps:
Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb
might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor
and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance
might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among
the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy
game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or
fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.

A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. *Mechanical traps*
include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling
blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. *Magic
traps* are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device
traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such
as [[file:10.spells.org::*Glyph of Warding][Glyph of Warding]] and [[file:10.spells.org::*Symbol][Symbol]] that function as traps.

*** Traps in Play                                                    :play:
When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is
triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the
characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.

**** Triggering a Trap                                        :triggering:
Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches
something that the trap's creator wanted to protect. Common triggers
include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor,
pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a
lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area
or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the  [[file:10.spells.org::*Glyph of Warding][Glyph of Warding]]
spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password
that prevents the trap from activating.

**** Detecting and Disabling a Trap                       :detect:disable:
Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection.
Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure
plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in
the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect
something that points to a trap's presence.

A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it,
disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt
a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap's DC. You can also compare
the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Wisdom
(Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the
trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it,
they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to
move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check
for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity
check using thieves' tools to perform the necessary sabotage.

Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or
disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap's
description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In
addition, [[file:10.spells.org::*Dispel Magic][Dispel Magic]] has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A
magic trap's description provides the DC for the ability check made when
you use /dispel magic/.

In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can
adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As
with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever
play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's
description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate
every possible action that the characters might attempt.

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an
ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For
example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the
character has found the trigger and no check is required.

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped
treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two
handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison
needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and
making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped.
Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and
push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the
trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the
shield.

Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed
or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their
lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such
traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret
door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.

**** Trap Effects                                                 :effect:
The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use
of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of
fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to
kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to
trigger them. A trap's description specifies what happens when it is
triggered.

The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the
damage it deals can vary depending on the trap's severity. Use the Trap
Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table
for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.

A trap intended to be a *setback* is unlikely to kill or seriously harm
characters of the indicated levels, whereas a *dangerous* trap is likely
to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated
levels. A *deadly* trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated
levels.

***** Table: Trap Dangers                                         :table:
| Trap Danger | Save DC | Attack Bonus |
|-------------+---------+--------------|
| Setback     | 10-11   | +3 to +5     |
| Dangerous   | 12-15   | +6 to +8     |
| Deadly      | 16-20   | +9 to +12    |

***** Table: Trap Severity                                        :table:
| Character Level | Setback | Dangerous | Deadly |
|-----------------+---------+-----------+--------|
| 1st-4th         | 1d10    | 2d10      | 4d10   |
| 5th-10th        | 2d10    | 4d10      | 10d10  |
| 11th-16th       | 4d10    | 10d10     | 18d10  |
| 17th-20th       | 10d10   | 18d10     | 24d10  |

**** Complex Traps                                               :complex:
Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they
execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process
of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.

When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap's
description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap
activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive
attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or
otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can
be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.

For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a
complex trap. On the trap's turn, the water level rises. After several
rounds, the room is completely flooded.

*** Sample Traps                                                   :sample:
The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and
are presented in alphabetical order.

**** Collapsing Roof                                          :mechanical:
This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable
section of a ceiling in place.

The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two
support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trip wire harmlessly.
A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with
disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check,
the trap triggers.

Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely
wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam,
causing the trap to trigger.

The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see
it can tell that it's in danger of collapse.

When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature
in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is
triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes
difficult terrain.

**** Falling Net                                              :mechanical:
This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.

The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two
columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to
spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check
using thieves' tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character
without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using
any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot
square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained,
and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked
prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10

Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a
success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage
to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot square section of it, freeing any
creature trapped in that section.

**** Fire-Breathing Statue                                 :magic:magical:
This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure
plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The
statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a
spell.

The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks
on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the
presence of magic, such as [[file:10.spells.org::*Detect Magic][Detect Magic]], reveals an aura of evocation
magic around the statue.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the
pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire.
Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents
the trap from activating. A successful [[file:10.spells.org::*Dispel Magic][Dispel Magic]] (DC 13) cast on
the statue destroys the trap.

**** Pits                                                 :mechanical:pit:
Four basic pit traps are presented here.

***** Simple Pit
A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole
is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit's edge and camouflaged
with dirt and debris.

The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through
and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit's
depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).

***** Hidden Pit
This pit has a cover constructed from material identical
to the floor around it.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot
traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit's cover. A
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to
confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a
pit.

When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor,
causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10
or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.

Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be
wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor in such a way
as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross.
The cover can also be magically held shut using the [[file:10.spells.org::*Arcane Lock][Arcane Lock]] spell
or similar magic.

***** Locking Pit
This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with
one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded.
After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its
victim inside.

A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open.
The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also
attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves' tools, provided that the mechanism can be
reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually
hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.

***** Spiked Pit
This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap
with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling
into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in
addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison
smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from
the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an
22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

**** Poison Darts                                             :mechanical:
When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts
shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the
surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each
one rigged to its own set of darts.

The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or
cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the
walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the
pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create
it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other
object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.
Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within
from launching.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the
pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack
with a +8

bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate
(vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in
the area, the darts don't hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2
(1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

**** Poison Needle                                            :mechanical:
A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's lock, or in
something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the
proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out
from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11
(2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character
to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to
accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using
thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock.
Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.

**** Rolling Sphere                                           :mechanical:
When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap's pressure
plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot
diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot
the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations
in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate's presence. The
same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the
stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other
object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll
initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it
moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures'
spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as
difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature's space or a
creature enters its space while it's rolling, that creature must succeed
on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage
and be knocked prone.

The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can't go
around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving
turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow
it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere's
speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere's speed drops to 0, it stops
moving and is no longer a threat.

**** Sphere of Annihilation                                :magic:magical:
Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face
carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly
circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of
it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth
contains a /sphere of annihilation/ that can't be controlled or moved.
It is otherwise identical to a normal /sphere of annihilation/.

Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone
face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to
approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like
the sympathy aspect of the [[file:10.spells.org::*Antipathy/Sympathy][Antipathy/Sympathy]] spell. A successful
[[file:10.spells.org::*Dispel Magic][Dispel Magic]] (DC 18) removes this enchantment.

** Diseases                                                        :disease:
A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find
a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for
centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A
warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that
spreads whenever he casts spells.

A simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on
party resources, curable by a casting of /lesser restoration/. A more
complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as
characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal
with the consequences.

A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a
plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how
it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren't bound
by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given
illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to
another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep
through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What
matters is the story you want to tell.

*** Sample Diseases                                                :sample:
The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the
game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times,
symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your
campaign.

**** Cackle Fever                                                  :fever:
This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune.
While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits
of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid
nickname: "the shrieks."

Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and
disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that
can't be removed until the disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress-including
entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a
nightmare-forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes
incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad
laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.

Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected
creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once
a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of
that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save
and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When
the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.
A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly
determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this
chapter.

**** Sewer Plague                                                 :plague:
Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that
incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are
sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as
rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the
disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated
by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or become infected.

It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague's symptoms to manifest in an infected
creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature
suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal
number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from
finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one
level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character's exhaustion
level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the
infected creature's level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers
from the disease.

**** Sight Rot                                                       :rot:
This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually
blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after
infection, the creature's vision starts to become blurry. The creature
takes a -1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on
sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the
penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches -5, the victim is blinded until
its sight is restored by magic such as [[file:10.spells.org::*Lesser Restoration][Lesser Restoration]] or [[file:10.spells.org::*Heal][Heal]].

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows
in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an
herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to
the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from
worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the
disease entirely.

** Madness                                                         :madness:
In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they
face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the
stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign
has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to
reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of
the threats the adventurers face.

*** Going Mad
Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind.
Certain spells, such as [[file:10.spells.org::*Contact Other Plane][Contact Other Plane]] and [[file:10.spells.org::*Symbol][Symbol]], can cause
insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell
effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as
psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict
madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who
uses or becomes attuned to them.

Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or
Charisma saving throw.

*** Madness Effects                                                :effect:
Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively
mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few
minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in
long-term or indefinite madness.

A character afflicted with *short-term madness* is subjected to an
effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.

A character afflicted with *long-term madness* is subjected to an effect
from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.

A character afflicted with *indefinite madness* gains a new character
flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.

| 31-40  | The character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell.                                                                      |
| 41-45  | The character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects.                                                                                                          |
| 46-55  | The character becomes attached to a "lucky charm," such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it.                                           |

| 66-75  | The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity.                                                           |
| 76-85  | The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn't recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect. |

*** Curing Madness                                            :cure:curing:
A [[file:10.spells.org::*Calm Emotions][Calm Emotions]] spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a
[[file:10.spells.org::*Lesser Restoration][Lesser Restoration]] spell can rid a character of a short-term or
long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, [[file:10.spells.org::*Remove Curse][Remove Curse]]
or [[file:10.spells.org::*Dispel Evil and Good][Dispel Evil and Good]] might also prove effective. A [[file:10.spells.org::*Greater Restoration][Greater Restoration]]
spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of
indefinite madness.

** Objects                                                  :object:objects:
When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a
vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time
and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use
common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an
object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a
sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.

For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item
like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building
or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.

*** Statistics for Objects                                          :stats:
When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a
destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and
vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.

**** Armor Class                                       :ac:AC:armor_class:
An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult
it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object
has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table
provides suggested AC values for various substances.

***** Table: Object's Armor Class                                 :table:
| Substance           | AC |
|---------------------+----|
| Cloth, paper, rope  | 11 |
| Crystal, glass, ice | 13 |
| Wood, bone          | 15 |
| Stone               | 17 |
| Iron, steel         | 19 |
| Mithral             | 21 |
| Adamantine          | 23 |

**** Hit Points                                         :hp:HP:hit_points:
An object's hit points measure how much damage it can
take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more
hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit
points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is
just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points
table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects
that are Large or smaller.

***** Table: Object's Hit Points                                  :table:
| Size                                | Fragile  | Resilient |
|-------------------------------------+----------+-----------|
| Tiny (bottle, lock)                 | 2 (1d4)  | 5 (2d4)   |
| Small (chest, lute)                 | 3 (1d6)  | 10 (3d6)  |
| Medium (barrel, chandelier)         | 4 (1d8)  | 18 (4d8)  |
| Large (cart, 10-ft-by-10-ft window) | 5 (1d10) | 27 (5d10) |

**** Huge and Gargantuan Objects                                    :size:
Normal weapons are of little use
against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue,
towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can
burn a Huge tapestry, and an [[file:10.spells.org::*Earthquake][Earthquake]] spell can reduce a colossus to
rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you
like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand
whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points
for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each
section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could
ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human
might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.

**** Objects and Damage Types                                     :damage:
Objects are immune to poison and psychic
damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective
against a particular object or substance than others. For example,
bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting
through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to
fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't
effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.

**** Damage Threshold                                             :damage:
Big objects such as castle walls often have extra
resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage
threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage
from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage
threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that
fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered
superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.

** Poisons                                                          :poison:
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most
societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil
creatures.

*** Poisons come in the following four types                         :type:
**** Contact                                                     :contact:
Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains
potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches
contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

**** Ingested                                                   :ingested:
A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison
to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid.
You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as
allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a
failed save.

**** Inhaled                                                     :inhaled:
These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when
inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a
5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately
afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons,
as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

**** Injury                                                       :injury:
Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap
components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and
remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature
that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the
poison is exposed to its effects.
