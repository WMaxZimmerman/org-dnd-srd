The arctic-dwelling *winter wolf* is as large as a dire wolf but has
snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures
as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath
weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one
another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well
enough to follow simple conversations.

A *worg* is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring
creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across
the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those
creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it
feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and
Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.
