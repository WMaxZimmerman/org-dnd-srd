#+TITLE: Org DnD SRD

* Description
  A shared org file collection of DnD SRD files. This repository was started from the [[https://github.com/OldManUmby/OGL-SRD5][OGL-SRD5]] repository. However, I
  didn't want to simply fork the repository as the structure will shift to better suite the capabilities that org files
  can have within [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]].
