* Artificier
Masters of invention, artificers use ingenuity and
magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting
to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells
and inventions. You can find everything you need to
play one of these inventors in the next few sections.
Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their
arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use
alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of
artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and
few other characters can produce the right tool for a
job as well as an artificer.
ARTIFICERS IN MANY WORLDS
Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create
inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many
lives have been brightened or saved because of the
work of kind artificers, but countless lives have
also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations.
In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is
home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this
class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks
of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk
to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and
other wondrous devices operational.
Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries
from throughout the multiverse, and from there,
the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning
business that hires adventurers to fix problems that
others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron,
magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the
wondrous ingenuity of artificers.

STARTING EQUIPMENT
You start with the following equipment, in addition
to the equipment granted by your background:
any two simple weapons of your choice
• a light crossbow and 20 bolts
• your choice of studded leather armor or scale mail
• thieves' tools and a dungeoneer's pack
If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the
items offered by your background, you start with
5d4 x 10 gp to buy your equipment.
MULTI CLASSI N G A N D TH E A RTI FI CER
If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in
the Player's Handbook, here's what you need to know if
you choose artificer as one of you r classes.
Ability Score Minimum. As a multiclass character,
you must have at least an Intell igence score of 13 to
take a level in this class, or to take a level in another
· class if you are already an artificer.
Proficiencies Cained. If artificer isn't your initial
class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you
take your fi rst level as an artificer: l ight armor, medium
armor, shields, thieves' tools, tinker's tools.
Spell Slots. Add half your levels (rounded u p) in
the artificer class to the appropriate levels from other
classes to determine you r available spell slots. 
CLASS FEATURES
As an artificer, you gain the following class features,
which are summarized in the Artificer table.
MAGICAL TINKERING
1st-level artificer feature
You've learned how to invest a spark of magic into
mundane objects. To use this ability, you must have
thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand. You then
touch a Tiny nonmagical object as an action and
give it one of the following magical properties of
your choice:
• The object sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and
dim light for an additional 5 feet.
• Whenever tapped by a creature, the object emits a
recorded message that can be heard up to 10 feet
away. You utter the message when you bestow this
property on the object, and the recording can be
no more than 6 seconds long.
• The object continuously emits your choice of an
odor or a nonverbal sound (wind, waves, chirping,
or the like). The chosen phenomenon is perceivable up to 10 feet away.
• A static visual effect appears on one of the object's
surfaces. This effect can be a picture, up to 25
words of text, lines and shapes, or a mixture of
these elements, as you like.
The chosen property lasts indefinitely. As an
action, you can touch the object and end the property early.
You can bestow magic on multiple objects,
touching one object each time you use this feature,
though a single object can only bear one property
at a time. The maximum number of objects you
can affect with this feature at one time is equal to
your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one object). If you try to exceed your maximum, the oldest
property immediately ends, and then the new property applies.
SPELLCASTING
1st-level artificer feature
You've studied the workings of magic and how to
cast spells, channeling the magic through objects.
To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells
in a conventional way; you appear to produce
wonders from mundane items and outlandish
inventions.·
TOOLS REQUIRED
You produce your artificer spell effects through your
tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in
hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting
feature (meaning the spell has an "M" component
TH E MACI C OF ARTI FI CE
As an artificer, you use tools when you cast your
spells. When describing your spellcasting, think a bout
how you're using a tool. For example, if you cast cure
wounds using a lchemist's supplies, you could be
q uickly producing a salve. If you cast it using tinker's
tools, you might have a miniature mechanical spider
that binds wounds. The effect of the spell is the same
either way.
Such details don't limit you in any way or provide you
with any benefit beyond the spell's effects. You don't
have to j ustify how you 're using tools to cast a spell.
But describing your spel lcasting creatively is a fun way
to distinguish yourself from other spellcasters.
when you cast it). You must be proficient with the
tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of
these tools.
After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level,
you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.
CANTRIPS (0-LEVEL SPELLS)
You know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional
artificer cantrips of your choice, as shown in the
Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.
When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer can trips you know with
another cantrip from the artificer spell list.
PREPARING AND CASTING SPELLS
The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you
have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your
artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.
You prepare the list of artificer spells that are
available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer
spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half
your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one
spell). The spells must be of a level for which you
have spell slots.
For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you
have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots.
With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared
spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in
any combination. If you prepare the 1 st-level spell
cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a
2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it
from your list of prepared spells.
You can change your list of prepared spells when
you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your
spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level
for each spell on your list.
CHAPTER I I CHARACTER OPTIONS
SPELLCASTING ABILITY
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your artificer spells; your understanding of the theory behind
magic allows you to wield these spells with superior
skill. You use your Intelligence whenever an artificer
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the
saving throw DC for an artificer spell you cast and
when making an attack roll with one.
Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
I ntell igence modifier
Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your
I ntell igence modifier
RITUAL CASTING
You can cast an artificer spell as a ritual if that spell
has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.
ARTIFICER SPELL LIST
Here's the list of spells you consult when you learn
an artificer spell. The list is organized by spell level,
not charader level. If a spell can be cast as a ritual,
the ritual tag appears after the spell's name.
Each spell is in the Player's Handbook, unless it
has one asterisk (a spell in chapter 3) or two asterisks (a spell in Xanathar's Guide to Everything).

INFUSIONS KNOWN
When you gain this feature, pick four artificer infusions to learn, choosing from the "Artificer Infusions" section at the end of the class's description.
You learn additional infusions of your choice when
you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in
the Infusions Known column of the Artificer table.
Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer infusions you learned with
a new one.
INFUSING AN ITEM
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch a
nonmagical object and imbue it with one of your
artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. An
infusion works on only certain kinds of objects, as
specified in the infusion's description. If the item requires attunement, you can attune yourself to it the
instant you infuse the item. If you decide to attune to
the item later, you must do so using the normal process for attunement (see the attunement rules in the
Dungeon Master's Guide). 
Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but
when you die, the infusion vanishes after a number
of days equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1 day). The infusion also vanishes if you
replace your knowledge of the infusion.
You can infuse
.
more than one nonmagical object
at the end of a long rest; the maximum number of
objects appears in the Infused Items column of the
Artificer table. You must touch each of the objects,
and each of your infusions can be in only one object
at a time. Moreover, no object can bear more than
one of your infusions at a time. If you try to exceed
your maximum number of infusions, the oldest infusion ends, and then the new infusion applies.
If an infusion ends on an item that contains other
things, like a bag of holding, its contents harmlessly
appear in and around its space.
ARTIFICER SPECIALIST
3rd-level artificer feature
Choose the type of specialist you are: Alchemist,
Armorer, Artillerist, or Battle Smith, each of which
is detailed after the class's description. Your choice
grants you features at 5th level and again at 9th and
15th level.
THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE OB
3rd-level artificer feature
You've learned how to produce exactly the tool you
need: with thieves' tools or artisan's tools in hand,
you can magically create one set of artisan's tools in
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. This creation requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work, which
can coincide with a short or long rest. Though the
product of magic, the tools are nonmagical, and they
vanish when you use this feature again.
ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
4th-level artificer feature
When you reach 4th level and again at 8th, 1 2th,
16th, and 1 9th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase
two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,
you can't increase an ability score above 20 using
this feature.
TOOL EXPERTISE
6th-level artificer feature
Your proficiency bonus is now doubled for any
ability check you make that uses your proficiency
with a tool.
FLASH OF GENIUS
7th-level artificer feature
You've gained the ability to come up with solutions
under pressure. When you or another creature you
can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check
or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add
your Intelligence modifier to the roll.
You can use this feature a number of times equal
to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).
You regain all expended uses when you finish a
long rest.
MAGIC ITEM ADEPT
10th-level artificer feature
You've achieved a profound understanding of how to
use and make magic items:
• You can attune to up to four magic items at once.
• If you craft a magic item with a rarity of common or uncommon, it takes you a quarter of the
normal time, and it costs you half as much of the
usual gold.
SPELL- STORING ITEM
1 1th-level artificer feature
You can now store a spell in an object. Whenever
you finish a long rest, you can touch one simple or
martial weapon or one item that you can use as a
spellcasting focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a 1st- or 2nd-level spell from the artificer spell
list that requires 1 action to cast (you needn't have it
prepared).
DWARF ALCHEMIST WITH
liOMUNCULUS SERVANT
CHAPTER 1 J CHA RACTER OPTIONS
While holding the object, a creature can take an
action to produce the spell's effect from it, using
your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires concentration, the creature must concentrate.
The spell stays in the object until it's been used a
number of times equal to twice your Intelligence
modifier (minimum of twice) or until you use this
feature again to store a spell in an object.
MAGIC ITEM SAVANT
14th-level artificer feature
Your skill with magic items deepens:
• You can attune to up to five magic items at once.
• You ignore all class, race, spell, and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.
MAGIC ITEM MASTER
18th-level artificer feature
You can now attune to up to six magic items at once.
SOUL OF ARTIFICE
20th-level artificer feature
You have developed a mystical connection to your
magic items, which you can draw on for protection:
• You gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws per
magic item you are currently attuned to.
• If you're reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one of your
artificer infusions, causing you to drop to 1 hit
point instead of 0.
ARTIFICER SPEC IALISTS
Artificers pursue many disciplines. Here are specialist options you can choose from at 3rd level.

TASllA •
An Alchemist is an expert at combining reagents
to produce mystical effects. Alchemists use their
creations to give life and to leech it away. Alchemy
is the oldest of artificer traditions, and its versatility
has long been valued during times of war and peace.
TOOL P ROFICIENCY
3rd-level Alchemist feature
You gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies. If
you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of
your choice.
14 CHAPTER 1 J CHARACTER OPTIONS
ALCHEMIST SPELLS
3rd-level Alchemist feature
You always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the
Alchemist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the
number of artificer spells you prepare.
ALCHEM I ST SPELLS
Artificer Level Spell
3rd healing word, ray of sickness

EXPERIMENTAL ELIXIR
3rd-level Alchemist feature
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can magically produce an experimental elixir in an empty
flask you touch. Roll on the Experimental Elixir
table for the elixir's effect, which is triggered when
someone drinks the elixir. As an action, a creature
can drink the elixir or administer it to an incapacitated creature.
You can create additional experimental elixirs
by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher for
each one. When you do so, you use your action to
create the elixir in an empty flask you touch, and
you choose the elixir's effect from the Experimental
Elixir table.
Creating an experimental elixir requires you to
have alchemist supplies on your person, and any
elixir you create with this feature lasts until it is
drunk or until the end of your next long rest.
When you reach certain levels in this class, you
can make more elixirs at the end of a long rest: two
at 6th level and three at 15th level. Roll for each
elixir's effect separately. Each elixir requires its
own flask.
EXPE RIME N TA L ELIXIR

Healing. The drinker regains a n umber of hit points
equal to 2d4 + your I ntell igence modifier.
2 Swiftness. The drinker's walking speed increases by
10 feet for 1 hour.
3 Resilience. The drinker gains a +1 bonus to AC for
10 minutes.
4 Boldness. The drinker can roll a d4 and add the

they make for the next minute. 
d6 Effect
5 Flight. The drinker gains a flying speed of 10 feet for
10 minutes.
6 Transformation. The d rinker's body is transformed
as if by the alter self spell. The d rinker determines
the transformation caused by the spell, the effects
of which last for 10 minutes.
ALCHEMICAL SAVANT
5th-level Alchemist feature
You've developed masterful command of magical
chemicals, enhancing the healing and damage you
create through them. Whenever you cast a spell
using your alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting
focus, you gain a bonus to one roll of the spell. That
roll must restore hit points or be a damage roll that
deals acid, fire, necrotic, or poison damage, and
the bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +l).
RESTORATIVE REAGENTS
9th-level Alchemist feature
You can incorporate restorative reagents into some
of your works:
• Whenever a creature drinks an experimental
elixir you created, the creature gains temporary
hit points equal to 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier
(minimum of 1 temporary hit point).
• You can cast lesser restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell,
provided you use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus. You can do so a number of times
equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of
once), and you regain all expended uses when you
finish a long rest.
CHEMICAL MASTERY
15th-level Alchemist feature
You have been exposed to so many chemicals that
they pose little risk to you, and you can use them to
quickly end certain ailments:
• You gain resistance to acid damage and poison
damage, and you are immune to the poisoned
condition.
• You can cast greater restoration and heal without
expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell,
and without material components, provided you
use alchemist's supplies as the spellcasting focus.
Once you cast ·either spell with this feature, you
can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a
long rest.
ARMORER

TASllA'
An artificer who specializes as an Armorer modifies
armor to function almost like a second skin. The
armor is enhanced to hone the artificer's magic,
unleash potent attacks, and generate a formidable
defense. The artificer bonds with this armor, becoming one with it even as they experiment with it and
refine its magical capabilities.
TOOLS OF THE TRADE
3rd-level Armorer feature
You gain proficiency with heavy armor. You also
gain proficiency with smith's tools. If you already
have this tool proficiency, you gain proficiency with
one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
ARMORER SPELLS
3rd-level Armorer feature
You always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the
Armorer Spells table. These spells count as artificer
spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

ARCANE ARMOR
3rd-level Armorer feature
Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making armor a conduit for your magic. As an action,
you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing
into Arcane Armor, provided you have smith's
tools in hand.
You gain the following benefits while wearing
this armor:
• If the armor normally has a Strength requirement,
the arcane armor lacks this requirement for you.
• You can use the arcane armor as a spellcasting
focus for your artificer spells.
• The armor attaches to you and can't be removed
against your will. It also expands to cover your
entire body, although you can retract or deploy the
helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any
C H APTER 1 I C H ARACTER OPTIONS 
missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb
it replaces.
• You can doff or don the armor as an action.
The armor continues to be Arcane Armor until
you don another suit of armor or you die.
ARMOR MODEL
3rd-level Armorer feature
You can customize your Arcane Armor. When you
do so, choose one of the following armor models:
Guardian or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives
you special benefits while you wear it.
Each model includes a special weapon. When you
attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, to
the attack and damage rolls.
You can change the armor's model whenever you
finish a short or long rest, provided you have smith's
tools in hand.
Guardian. You design your armor to be in the
front line of conflict. It has the following features:
T hunder Gauntlets. Each of the armor's gauntlets
counts as a simpl_e melee weapon while you aren't
holding anything in it, and it deals ld8 thunder
damage on a hit. A creature hit by the gauntlet has
disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other
than you until the start of your next turn, as the armor magically emits a distracting pulse when the
creature attacks someone else.
16 C HAPTER 1 / CHA RACTER OPTIONS
Defensive Field. As a bonus action, you can gain
temporary hit points equal to your level in this
class, replacing any temporary hit points you already have. You lose these temporary hit points if
you doff the armor. You can use this bonus action
a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,
and you regain all expended uses when you finish
a long rest.
Infiltrator. You customize your armor for subtle
undertakings. It has the following features:
Lightning Launcher. A gemlike node appears on
one of your armored fists or on the chest (your
choice). It counts as a simple ranged weapon, with
a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300
feet, and it deals ld6 lightning damage on a hit.
Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with it, you can deal an extra ld6 lightning
damage to that target.
Powered Steps. Your walking speed increases
. by 5 feet.
Dampening Field. You have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks. If the armor normally imposes
disadvantage on such checks, the advantage and
disadvantage cancel each other, as normal.
EXTRA ATTACK
5th-level Armorer feature
You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.
• 
ARMOR MODIFICATIONS
9th-level Armorer feature
You learn how to use your artificer infusions to specially modify your Arcane Armor. That armor now
counts as separate items for the purposes of your
Infuse Items feature: armor (the chest piece), boots,
helmet, and the armor's special weapon. Each of
those items can bear one of your infusions, and the
infusions transfer over if you change your armor's
model with the Armor Model feature. In addition,
the maximum number of items you can infuse at
once increases by 2, but those extra items must be
part of your Arcane Armor.
PERFECTED ARMOR
15th-level Armorer feature
Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based
on its model, as shown below.
Guardian. When a Huge or smaller creature you
can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can
use your reaction to magically force the creature to
make a Strength saving throw against your spell

you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to
a space within 5 feet of you, you can make a melee
weapon attack against it as part of this reaction.
You can use this reaction a number of times equal
to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.
Infiltrator. Any creature that takes lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with
magical light until the start of your next turn. The
glimmering creature sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls against
you, as the light jolts it if it attacks you. In addition,
the next attack roll against it has advantage, and if
that attack hits, the target takes an extra ld6 lightning damage.

TASHA
An Artillerist specializes in using magic to hurl
energy, projectiles, and explosions on a battlefield.
This destructive power is valued by armies in the
wars on many different worlds. And when war
passes, some members of this specialization seek to
build a more peaceful world by using their powers
to fight the resurgence of strife. The world-hopping
gnome artificer Vi has been especially vocal about
making things right: "It's about time we fixed things
instead of blowing them all to hell."
TOOL PROFICIENCY
3rd-level Artillerist feature
You gain proficiency with woodcarver's tools. If you
already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency
with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.
ARTILLERIST SPELLS
3rd-level Artillerist feature
You always have certain spells prepared after you
reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the
Artillerist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the
number of artificer spells you prepare.

ELDRITCH CANNON
3rd-level Artillerist feature
You've learned how to create a magical cannon.
Using woodcarver's tools or smith's tools, you can
take an action to magically create a Small or Tiny
eldritch cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of you. A Small eldritch
cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be
held in one hand.
Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again
until you finish a long rest or until you expend a
spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present.
The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of
size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of
hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is
immune to poison damage and psychic damage. If it
is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw,
treat all its ability scores as 10 (+O). If the mending
spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour.
You can dismiss it early as an action.
When you create the cannon, you determine its
appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on
the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns,
you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to
activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the
same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to
walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space,
provided it has legs.

ARCANE FIREARM
5th-level Artillerist feature
You know how to turn a wand, staff, or rod into an
arcane firearm, a conduit for your destructive spells.
When you finish a long rest, you can use woodcarver's tools to carve special sigils into a wand, staff,
or rod and thereby turn it into your arcane firearm.
The sigils disappear from the object if you later
carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise
last indefinitely.
You can use your arcane firearm as a spellcasting
focus for your artificer spells. When you cast an artificer spell through the firearm, roll a d8, and you
gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal
to the number rolled.
EXPLOSIVE CANNON
9th-level Artillerist feature
Every eldritch cannon you create is now more
destructive:
• The cannon's damage rolls all increase by ld8.
• As an action, you can command the cannon to
detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so
destroys the cannon and forces each creature
within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving
throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d8 force
damage on a failed save or half as much damage
on a successful one.
FORTIFIED POSITION
15th-level Artillerist feature
You're a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon:
• You and your allies have half cover while within
10 feet of a cannon you create with Eldritch Cannon, as a result of a shimmering field of magical
protection that the cannon emits.
• You can now have two cannons at the same time.
You can create two with the same action (but not
the same spell slot), and you can activate both of
them with the same bonus action. You determine
whether the cannons are identical to each other
or different. You can't create a third cannon while
you have two.

TASHA 
Armies require protection, and someone has to put
things back together if defenses fail. A combination
of protector and medic, a Battle Smith is an expert
at defending others and repairing both materiel and
personnel. To aid in their work, Battle Smiths are
accompanied by a steel defender, a protective companion of their own creation. Many soldiers tell stories of nearly dying before being saved by a Battle
Smith and a steel defender.
In t.he world of Eberron, Battle Smiths played
a key role in House Cannith's work on battle constructs and the original warforged, and after the
Last War, these artificers led efforts to aid those
who were injured in the war's horrific battles.

BATTLE READY
3rd-level Battle Smith feature
Your combat training and your experiments with
magic have paid off in two ways:
• You gain proficiency with martial weapons.
• When you attack with a magic weapon, you
can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of
Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and
damage rolls.
STEEL DEFENDER
3rd-level Battle Smith feature
Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a steel
defender. It's friendly to you and your companions,
and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the Steel Defender stat block, which uses
your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You
determine the creature's appearance and whether it
has two legs or four; your choice has no effect on its
game statistics.
In combat, the defender shares your initiative
count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.
It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the
only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action,
unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be
one in its stat block or some other action. If you are
incapacitated, the defender can take any action of its
choice, not just Dodge.
If the mending spell is cast on the defender, it
regains 2d6 hit points. If it has died within the last
hour, you can use your smith's tools as an action
to revive it, provided you are within 5 feet of it and
you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The
defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit
points restored.
At the end of a long rest, you can create a new
steel defender if you have smith's tools with you. If
you already have a defender from this feature, the
first one immediately perishes. The defender also
perishes if you die.

target, you can channel magical energy through the
strike to create one of the following effects:
• The target takes an extra 2d6 force damage.
• Choose one creature or object you can see within
30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the
chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 hit points to it.

to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but
you can do so no more than once on a turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a
rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing
heavy armor:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus
  to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian,
  as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
- You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on
them while raging.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked
unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile
creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also
end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level
in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest
before you can rage again.

*** Unarmored Defense
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: unarmored-defense
    :END:

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield
and still gain this benefit.

*** Reckless Attack
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: reckless-attack
    :END:

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to
attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your
turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage
on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack
rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

*** Danger Sense
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: danger-sense
    :END:

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you
can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be
blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

*** Primal Path
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: primal-path
    :END:

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.
Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Extra Attack
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: extra-attack
    :END:

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

*** Fast Movement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: fast-movement
    :END:

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't
wearing heavy armor.

*** Feral Instinct
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: feral-instinct
    :END:

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on
initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't
incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you
enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

*** Brutal Critical
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: brutal-critical
    :END:

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die
when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee
attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional
dice at 17th level.

*** Relentless Rage
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: relentless-rage
    :END:

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don't die
outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you
succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.
When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.

*** Persistent Rage
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: persistent-rage
    :END:

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only
if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

*** Indomitable Might
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: indomitable-might
    :END:

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than
your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

*** Primal Champion
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: primal-champion
    :END:

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and
Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now
24.

** Barbarian Paths
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: barbarian-paths
   :END:

*** Path of the Berserker
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: path-of-the-berserker
    :END:

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end- that end being violence.
The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with
blood. As you enter the berserker's rage, you thrill in the chaos of
battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.

**** Frenzy
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: frenzy
     :END:

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a
frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you
can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your
turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of
exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

**** Mindless Rage
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: mindless-rage
     :END:

Beginning at 6th level, you can't be charmed or frightened while raging.
If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
suspended for the duration of the rage.

**** Intimidating Presence
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: intimidating-presence
     :END:

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone
with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that
you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you,
it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you
until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your
action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature
until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends
its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature
on that creature again for 24 hours.

**** Retaliation
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: retaliation
     :END:

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
attack against that creature.

harmony with your wishes and music.

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to
different situations.

     :CUSTOM_ID: cantrips
     :END:

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn
additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.

**** Spell Slots
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spell-slots
     :END:

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell /cure wounds/ and have a
1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast /cure
wounds/ using either slot.

**** Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher
     :END:

You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard
spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.

**** Spellcasting Ability
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-ability
     :END:

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic
comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your
music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier

**** Ritual Casting

spells.

*** Bardic Inspiration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bardic-inspiration
    :END:

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you
use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than
yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one
Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add
the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it
makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before
deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the
GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration
die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in
this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and
a d12 at 15th level.

*** Jack of All Trades
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: jack-of-all-trades
    :END:

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded
down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your
proficiency bonus.

*** Song of Rest
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: song-of-rest
    :END:

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help
revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any
friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at
the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of
those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this
class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th
level.

*** Bard College
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: bard-college
    :END:

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college
of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.

*** Expertise
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: expertise
    :END:

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency
bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the
chosen proficiencies.

this benefit.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:

of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

*** Countercharm
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: countercharm
    :END:

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of
power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a
performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that
time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have
advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A
creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance
ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily
end it (no action required).

*** Magical Secrets
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: magical-secrets
    :END:

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum
of disciplines. Choose two spells from any classes, including this one.
A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the
number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any classes at 14th level and again
at 18th level.

*** Superior Inspiration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: superior-inspiration
    :END:

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic
Inspiration left, you regain one use.

** Bard Colleges
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: bard-colleges
   :END:

*** College of Lore
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: college-of-lore
    :END:

Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things,
collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes
and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold
audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members
might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to
the king.

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not
in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who
keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would
rather be honest than politic.

The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual
colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore
with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where
they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important
figures of authority.

**** Bonus Proficiencies
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: bonus-proficiencies
     :END:

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with three skills of your choice.

**** Cutting Words
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: cutting-words
     :END:

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse,
and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an
ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one
of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and
subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll. You can choose
to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM
determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails,
or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it
can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

**** Additional Magical Secrets
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: additional-magical-secrets
     :END:

At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A
spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but

*** Spellcasting
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-1
    :END:

As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

**** Cantrips
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: cantrips-1
     :END:

At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric
spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric
table.

**** Preparing and Casting Spells
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: preparing-and-casting-spells
     :END:

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric
level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and
two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared
spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.
If you prepare the 1st-level spell /cure wounds/, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from
your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

**** Spellcasting Ability
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-ability-1
     :END:

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of
your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom
whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**** Ritual Casting
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: ritual-casting-1
     :END:

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell prepared.

**** Spellcasting Focus
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-focus-1
     :END:

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your cleric
spells.

*** Divine Domain
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: divine-domain
    :END:

Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature,
Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the
class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated
with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when
you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use
Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional
benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

**** Domain Spells
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: domain-spells
     :END:

Each domain has a list of spells - its domain spells - that you gain at
the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a
domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against
the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn't appear on the cleric spell list,
the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

*** Channel Divinity
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: channel-divinity
    :END:

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly
from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start
with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your
domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create.
You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such
an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between
rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between
rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended
uses.

**** Channel Divinity: Turn Undead
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: channel-divinity-turn-undead
     :END:

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring
the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw,
it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-2
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Destroy Undead
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: destroy-undead
    :END:

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against
your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its
challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the
Destroy Undead table.

*Table- Destroy Undead*

| Cleric Level | Destroys Undead of CR ... |
|--------------+---------------------------|
| 5th          | 1/2 or lower              |
| 8th          | 1 or lower                |
| 11th         | 2 or lower                |
| 14th         | 3 or lower                |
| 17th         | 4 or lower                |

*** Divine Intervention
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: divine-intervention
    :END:

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your
behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity's aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number
equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell
or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can't use this feature again for 7 days.
Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no
roll required.

** Cleric Domains
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: cleric-domains
   :END:

*** Life Domain
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: life-domain
    :END:

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy-one of the
fundamental forces of the universe-that sustains all life. The gods of
life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and
undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain,
particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and
Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of
healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht),
and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

*Table- Life Domain Spells*

| Cleric Level | Spells                               |
|--------------+--------------------------------------|
| 1st          | bless, cure wounds                   |
| 3rd          | lesser restoration, spiritual weapon |
| 5th          | beacon of hope, revivify             |
| 7th          | death ward, guardian of faith        |
| 9th          | mass cure wounds, raise dead         |

**** Bonus Proficiency
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: bonus-proficiency
     :END:

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with
heavy armor.

**** Disciple of Life
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: disciple-of-life
     :END:

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective.
Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to
a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the
spell's level.

**** Channel Divinity: Preserve Life
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: channel-divinity-preserve-life
     :END:

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the
badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that
can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric
level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit
points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than
half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead
or a construct.

**** Blessed Healer
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: blessed-healer
     :END:

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you
as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit
points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 +
the spell's level.

**** Divine Strike
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: divine-strike
     :END:

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant
damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.

**** Supreme Healing
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: supreme-healing
     :END:

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to
restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number
possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points
to a creature, you restore 12.

*** Druidic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: druidic
    :END:

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the
language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know
this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but
can't decipher it without magic.

*** Spellcasting
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-2
    :END:

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to
shape that essence to your will.

**** Cantrips
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: cantrips-2
     :END:

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell
list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher
levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

**** Preparing and Casting Spells
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: preparing-and-casting-spells-1
     :END:

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you
must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast,
choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of
druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum
of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and
two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared
spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.
If you prepare the 1st-level spell /cure wounds/, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from
your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer
and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

*** Spellcasting Ability
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-ability-2
    :END:

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your
magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

*** Ritual Casting
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ritual-casting-2
    :END:

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell prepared.

**** Spellcasting Focus
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-focus-2
     :END:

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid
spells.

*** Wild Shape
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: wild-shape
    :END:

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the
shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature
twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown
in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform
into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't
have a flying or swimming speed.

*Table- Beast Shapes*

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations                 | Example     |
|-------+---------+-----------------------------+-------------|
| 2nd   | 1/4     | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf        |
| 4th   | 1/2     | No flying speed             | Crocodile   |
| 8th   | 1       | -                           | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your
druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless
you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically
revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but
  you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
  Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw
  proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
  creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat
  block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours.
  If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
- When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice.
  When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
  points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
  result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
  your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form
  and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long
  as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points,
  you aren't knocked unconscious.
- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action
  that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.
  Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've
  already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are
  part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other
  source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing
  so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as
  darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
  merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions
  as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new form
  to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size.
  Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and
  any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the
  ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no
  effect until you leave the form.

*** Druid Circle
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: druid-circle
    :END:

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle
of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the
class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and
again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-3
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Timeless Body
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: timeless-body
    :END:

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to
age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
year.

*** Beast Spells
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: beast-spells
    :END:

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any
shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and
verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you
aren't able to provide material components.

*** Archdruid
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: archdruid
    :END:

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your
druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and
aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal
shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

** Druid Circles
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: druid-circles
   :END:

*** Circle of the Land
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: circle-of-the-land
    :END:

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard
ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids
meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal
secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief
priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors
to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is
influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's
mysterious rites.

**** Bonus Cantrip
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: bonus-cantrip
     :END:

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid
cantrip of your choice.

**** Natural Recovery
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: natural-recovery
     :END:

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by
sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest,
you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You
can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two
levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or
two 1st-level slots.

**** Circle Spells
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: circle-spells
     :END:

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to
cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to
circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose
that land-arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or
swamp-and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and
it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell
list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

**** Land's Stride
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: lands-stride
     :END:

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs
you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created
by the /entangle/ spell.

**** Nature's Ward
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: natures-ward
     :END:

When you reach 10th level, you can't be charmed or frightened by
elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

**** Nature's Sanctuary
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: natures-sanctuary
     :END:

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your
connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or
plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a
successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against
you.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Sacred Plants and Wood*

  A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,
  birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow,
  and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus,
  incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.

  Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as
  weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so
  weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it.
  Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make
  excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as
  well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used
  for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.

  Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen
  other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a
  desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

  *Druids and the Gods*

  Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids
  are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the
  multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such
  deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more
  ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.

*** Unarmored Defense
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: unarmored-defense-1
    :END:

Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding
a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom
modifier.

*** Martial Arts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: martial-arts
    :END:

At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat
styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords
and any simple melee weapons that don't have the two- handed or heavy
property.

You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only
monk weapons and you aren't wearing armor or wielding a shield:

- You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
  rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.
- You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike
  or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in
  the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.
- When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon
  on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For
  example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff,
  you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you
  haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For
example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a
short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can
use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

*** Ki
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ki
    :END:

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic
energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of
ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as
shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start
knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step
of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this
class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or
long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back
into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating
to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to
resist the feature's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
follows:

*Ki save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

**** Flurry of Blows
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: flurry-of-blows
     :END:

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend
1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

     :END:

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on
your turn.

**** Step of the Wind
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: step-of-the-wind

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus
action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: unarmored-movement
    :END:

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not
wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach
certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and
across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

*** Monastic Tradition
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: monastic-tradition
    :END:

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition:
the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four
Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your
tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and
17th level.

*** Deflect Missiles
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: deflect-missiles
    :END:

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the
missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the
damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small
enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.
If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as
part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency,
regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a
monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a
long range of 60 feet.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-5
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Slow Fall
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: slow-fall
    :END:

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to
reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your
monk level.

*** Extra Attack
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: extra-attack-2
    :END:

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

*** Stunning Strike
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: stunning-strike
    :END:

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an
opponent's body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The
target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until
the end of your next turn.

*** Ki-Empowered Strikes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ki-empowered-strikes
    :END:

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and
damage.

*** Evasion
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: evasion
    :END:

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of
certain area effects, such as a blue dragon's lightning breath or a
/fireball/ spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take
no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if
you fail.

*** Stillness of Mind
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: stillness-of-mind
    :END:

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on
yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: tongue-of-the-sun-and-moon
    :END:

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that
you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can
understand a language can understand what you say.

*** Diamond Soul
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: diamond-soul
    :END:

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in
all saving throws.

Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1
ki point to reroll it and take the second result.

*** Timeless Body
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: timeless-body-1
    :END:

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the
frailty of old age, and you can't be aged magically. You can still die
of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

*** Empty Body
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: empty-body
    :END:

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to
become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have
resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the /astral projection/
spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can't
take any other creatures with you.

*** Perfect Self
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: perfect-self
    :END:

At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points
remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

** Monastic Traditions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: monastic-traditions
   :END:

Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries
scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition
exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk
according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely
on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept.
Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

*** Way of the Open Hand
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: way-of-the-open-hand
    :END:

Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial
arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and
trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and
practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

**** Open Hand Technique
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: open-hand-technique
     :END:

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate
your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature
with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose
one of the following effects on that target:

- It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up
  to 15 feet away from you.
- It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.

**** Wholeness of Body
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: wholeness-of-body
     :END:

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you
can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

**** Tranquility
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: tranquility
     :END:

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that
surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain
the effect of a /sanctuary/ spell that lasts until the start of your
next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC
for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

**** Quivering Palm
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: quivering-palm
     :END:

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in
someone's body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can
spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last
for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are
harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the
target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action,
the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is
reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a
time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an
action.

*** Divine Sense
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: divine-sense
    :END:

The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious
odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an
action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end
of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or
undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know
the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you
sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for
instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any
place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the
/hallow/ spell.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma
modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

*** Lay on Hands
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: lay-on-hands
    :END:

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power
that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to
restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum
amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to
cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it.
You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a
single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each
one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

*** Fighting Style
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: fighting-style-1
    :END:

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose
one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option
more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

**** Defense
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: defense-1
     :END:

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**** Dueling
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: dueling-1
     :END:

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

**** Great Weapon Fighting
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: great-weapon-fighting-1
     :END:

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a
melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the
die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

**** Protection
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: protection-1
     :END:

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage
on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

*** Spellcasting
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-3
    :END:

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through
meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.

**** Preparing and Casting Spells
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: preparing-and-casting-spells-2
     :END:

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or
higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your
paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be
of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and
two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared
spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination.
If you prepare the 1st-level spell /cure wounds/, you can cast it using
a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it
from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

**** Spellcasting Ability
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-ability-3
     :END:

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since
their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier

**** Spellcasting Focus
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-focus-3
     :END:

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin
spells.

*** Divine Smite
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: divine-smite
    :END:

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the
target, in addition to the weapon's damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for
a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st,
to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an
undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.

*** Divine Health
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: divine-health
    :END:

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to
disease.

*** Sacred Oath
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sacred-oath
    :END:

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin
forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed
to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of
Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all
detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and
20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity
feature.

**** Oath Spells
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: oath-spells
     :END:

Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these
spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain
access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don't
count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list,
the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

**** Channel Divinity
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: channel-divinity-1
     :END:

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects.
Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use
it.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You
must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such
an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-6
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Extra Attack
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: extra-attack-3
    :END:

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

*** Aura of Protection
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: aura-of-protection
    :END:

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10
feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the
saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of
+1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

*** Aura of Courage
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: aura-of-courage
    :END:

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you
can't be frightened while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

*** Improved Divine Smite
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: improved-divine-smite
    :END:

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your
melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a
creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant
damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this
damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.

*** Cleansing Touch
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: cleansing-touch
    :END:

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on
yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a
long rest.

** Sacred Oaths
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sacred-oaths
   :END:

Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the
cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final
oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all
the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider
themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this
oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an
official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.

*** Oath of Devotion
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: oath-of-devotion
    :END:

The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice,
virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy
warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,
acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or
worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear
this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets
as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels-the perfect servants
of good-as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into
their helmets or coats of arms.

**** Tenets of Devotion
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: tenets-of-devotion
     :END:

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary,
paladins of this oath share these tenets.

*/Honesty/*. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

*/Courage/*. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

*/Compassion/*. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who
threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

*/Honor/*. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be
an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least
amount of harm.

*/Duty/*. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences,
protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just
authority over you.

**** Oath Spells
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: oath-spells-1
     :END:

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

*Table- Oath of Devotion Spells*

| Level | Paladin Spells                           |
|-------+------------------------------------------|
| 3rd   | protection from evil and good, sanctuary |
| 5th   | lesser restoration, zone of truth        |
| 9th   | beacon of hope, dispel magic             |
| 13th  | freedom of movement, guardian of faith   |
| 17th  | commune, flame strike                    |

**** Channel Divinity
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: channel-divinity-2
     :END:

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel
Divinity options.

*/Sacred Weapon/*. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are
holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute,
you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon
(with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a
20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not
already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you
are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall
unconscious, this effect ends.

*/Turn the Unholy/*. As an action, you present your holy symbol and
speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity.
Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it
is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.

**** Aura of Devotion
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: aura-of-devotion
     :END:

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you
can't be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

***** Purity of Spirit
      :PROPERTIES:
      :CUSTOM_ID: purity-of-spirit
      :END:

Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a
/protection from evil and good/ spell.

**** Holy Nimbus
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: holy-nimbus
     :END:

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1
minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and dim light
shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the
creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws
against spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Breaking Your Oath*

  A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even
  the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves
  too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two
  evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to
  transgress his or her oath.

  A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a
  cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same
  order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a sign
  of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After
  a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.

  If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of
  repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's
  discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this
  class and adopt another.

*** Favored Enemy
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: favored-enemy
    :END:

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying,
tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials,
constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities,
oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of
humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored
enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about
them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice
that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated
language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should
reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

*** Natural Explorer
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: natural-explorer
    :END:

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and
are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of
favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or
swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your
favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a
skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain
the following benefits:

- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
- Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as
  foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
- While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number,
  their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

*** Fighting Style
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: fighting-style-2
    :END:

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a
Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose
again.

**** Archery
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: archery-1
     :END:

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

**** Defense
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: defense-2
     :END:

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

**** Dueling
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: dueling-2
     :END:

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

**** Two-Weapon Fighting
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: two-weapon-fighting-1
     :END:

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
modifier to the damage of the second attack.

*** Spellcasting
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-4
    :END:

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical
essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See the general
rules for spellcasting and the ranger spell list.

**** Spell Slots
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spell-slots-1
     :END:

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell /animal friendship/ and
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
/animal friendship/ using either slot.

**** Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher-1
     :END:

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more
ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

**** Spellcasting Ability
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-ability-4
     :END:

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your
magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

*** Ranger Archetype
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ranger-archetype
    :END:

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter
or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your
choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th
level.

*** Primeval Awareness
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: primeval-awareness
    :END:

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger
spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1
minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the
following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within
up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations,
celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature
doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-7
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Extra Attack
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: extra-attack-4
    :END:

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

*** Land's Stride
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: lands-stride-1
    :END:

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs
you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created
by the /entangle/ spell.

*** Hide in Plain Sight
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: hide-in-plain-sight
    :END:

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for
yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and
other naturally occurring materials with which to create your
camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing
yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at
least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity
(Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking
actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must
camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

*** Vanish
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: vanish
    :END:

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on
your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you
choose to leave a trail.

*** Feral Senses
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: feral-senses
    :END:

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight
creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your
inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls
against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30
feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you
aren't blinded or deafened.

*** Foe Slayer
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: foe-slayer
    :END:

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once
on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack
roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your
favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

** Ranger Archetypes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: ranger-archetypes
   :END:

The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the
Beast Master.

*** Hunter
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: hunter
    :END:

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark
between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the
Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats
you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and
terrifying dragons.

**** Hunter's Prey
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: hunters-prey
     :END:

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

*/Colossus Slayer/*. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an
extra 1d8 damage if it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this
extra damage only once per turn.

*/Giant Killer/*. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you
hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack
that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see
the creature.

*/Horde Breaker/*. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon
attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a
different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and
within range of your weapon.

**** Defensive Tactics
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: defensive-tactics
     :END:

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

*/Escape the Horde/*. Opportunity attacks against you are made with
disadvantage.

*/Multiattack Defense/*. When a creature hits you with an attack, you
gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that
creature for the rest of the turn.

*/Steel Will/*. You have advantage on saving throws against being
frightened.

**** Multiattack
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: multiattack
     :END:

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

*/Volley/*. You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any
number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your
weapon's range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and
you make a separate attack roll for each target.

*/Whirlwind Attack/*. You can use your action to make a melee attack
against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate
attack roll for each target.

**** Superior Hunter's Defense
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: superior-hunters-defense
     :END:

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

*/Evasion/*. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's
fiery breath or a /lightning bolt/ spell, that allows you to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you
fail.

*/Stand Against the Tide/*. When a hostile creature misses you with a
melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat
the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your
choice.

*/Uncanny Dodge/*. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an
attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against
you.

* Rogue

*** Class Features
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: class-features-8
    :END:

*** Expertise
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: expertise-1
    :END:

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your
skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves' tools. Your
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills
or with thieves' tools) to gain this benefit.

*** Sneak Attack
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sneak-attack
    :END:

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a
foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack
roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't incapacitated, and you
don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this
class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

*** Thieves' Cant
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: thieves-cant
    :END:

During your rogue training you learned thieves' cant, a secret mix of
dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly
normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves' cant
understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a
message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to
convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or
the territory of a thieves' guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether
the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for
thieves on the run.

*** Cunning Action
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: cunning-action
    :END:

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move
and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in
combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or
Hide action.

*** Roguish Archetype
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: roguish-archetype
    :END:

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise
of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all
detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice
grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th
level.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-8
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Uncanny Dodge
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: uncanny-dodge
    :END:

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage
against you.

*** Evasion
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: evasion-1
    :END:

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain
area effects, such as a red dragon's fiery breath or an /ice storm/
spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you
fail.

*** Reliable Talent
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: reliable-talent
    :END:

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach
perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

*** Blindsense
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: blindsense
    :END:

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the
location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

*** Slippery Mind
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: slippery-mind
    :END:

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain
proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

*** Elusive
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: elusive
    :END:

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain
the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you
while you aren't incapacitated.

*** Stroke of Luck
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: stroke-of-luck
    :END:

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need
to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss
into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat
the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

** Roguish Archetypes
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: roguish-archetypes
   :END:

Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on
perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat,
and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those
talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your
choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus-not necessarily an
indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your
preferred techniques.

*** Thief
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: thief
    :END:

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits,
cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so
do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure
seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving
your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you
normally couldn't employ.

**** Fast Hands
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: fast-hands
     :END:

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your
thieves' tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an
Object action.

**** Second-Story Work
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: second-story-work
     :END:

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover
increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

**** Supreme Sneak
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: supreme-sneak
     :END:

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check
if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

**** Use Magic Device
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: use-magic-device
     :END:

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that
you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for
you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of
magic items.

**** Thief's Reflexes
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: thiefs-reflexes

*** Spellcasting
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-5
    :END:

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an
indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of
magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

**** Cantrips
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: cantrips-3
     :END:

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer
spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer
table.

**** Spell Slots
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spell-slots-2
     :END:

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
sorcerer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer
spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell /burning hands/ and have a
1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast /burning
hands/ using either slot.

**** Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher-2
     :END:

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell
list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more
sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

**** Spellcasting Ability
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-ability-5
     :END:

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since
the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into
the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier

**** Spellcasting Focus
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-focus-4
     :END:

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer
spells.

*** Sorcerous Origin
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sorcerous-origin
    :END:

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate
magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the
end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and
again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

*** Font of Magic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: font-of-magic
    :END:

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself.
This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to
create a variety of magical effects.

     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: sorcery-points
     :END:

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels,
as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can
never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level.
You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

**** Flexible Casting
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: flexible-casting
     :END:

You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or
sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other
ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels. Any spell
slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.

*/Creating Spell Slots/*. You can transform unexpended sorcery points
into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell
Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level.
You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a
long rest.

*Table- Creating Spell Slots*

| Spell Slot Level | Sorcery Point Cost |
|------------------+--------------------|
| 1st              | 2                  |

turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points
equal to the slot's level.

*** Metamagic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: metamagic
    :END:

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your
needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.
You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,
unless otherwise noted.

**** Careful Spell
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: careful-spell
     :END:

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving
throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full
force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A
chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the
spell.

**** Distant Spell
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: distant-spell
     :END:

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can

point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: empowered-spell
     :END:

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different
Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

**** Extended Spell
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: extended-spell
     :END:

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of
24 hours.

**** Heightened Spell
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: heightened-spell
     :END:

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to
resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of
the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

**** Quickened Spell
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: quickened-spell
     :END:

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend
2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this
casting.

**** Subtle Spell
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: subtle-spell
     :END:

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without
any somatic or verbal components.

**** Twinned Spell
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: twinned-spell
     :END:

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a
range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the
spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell
(1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one
creature at the spell's current level. For example, /magic missile/ and
/scorching ray/ aren't eligible, but /ray of frost/ and /chromatic orb/
are.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-9
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Sorcerous Restoration
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: sorcerous-restoration
    :END:

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish
a short rest.

** Sorcerous Origins
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: sorcerous-origins
   :END:

Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic.
Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two
categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.

*** Draconic Bloodline
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: draconic-bloodline
    :END:

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your
blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin
trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made
a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent.
Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are
obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

**** Dragon Ancestor
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: dragon-ancestor
     :END:

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage
type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

*Table- Draconic Ancestry*

| Dragon | Damage Type |
|--------+-------------|
| Black  | Acid        |
| Blue   | Lightning   |
| Brass  | Fire        |
| Bronze | Lightning   |
| Copper | Acid        |
| Gold   | Fire        |
| Green  | Poison      |
| Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        |
| White  | Cold        |

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make
a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus
is doubled if it applies to the check.

**** Draconic Resilience
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: draconic-resilience
     :END:

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your
dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum
increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in
this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of
dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 +
your Dexterity modifier.

**** Elemental Affinity
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: elemental-affinity
     :END:

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the
type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma
modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

**** Dragon Wings
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: dragon-wings
     :END:

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings
from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You
can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until
you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is
made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your
wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

**** Draconic Presence
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: draconic-presence
     :END:

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your
dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or
frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this
power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60
feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were
casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its
turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed
(if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura
ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your
aura for 24 hours.

*** Otherworldly Patron
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: otherworldly-patron
    :END:

At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of
your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of which
is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

*** Pact Magic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pact-magic
    :END:

Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have
given you facility with spells.

**** Cantrips
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: cantrips-4
     :END:

You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You
learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.

**** Spell Slots
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spell-slots-3
     :END:

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
warlock spells of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the
level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To
cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend
a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a
short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.
To cast the 1st-level spell /witch bolt/, you must spend one of those
slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.

**** Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher-3
     :END:

At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more
warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you
choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's
Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example,
you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

**** Spellcasting Ability
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-ability-6
     :END:

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you
use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
modifier

**** Spellcasting Focus
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: spellcasting-focus-5
     :END:

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock
spells.

*** Eldritch Invocations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: eldritch-invocations
    :END:

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations,
fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical
ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your
invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.
When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of
your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock
table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you
could learn at that level.

*** Pact Boon
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: pact-boon
    :END:

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your
loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

**** Pact of the Chain
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: pact-of-the-chain
     :END:

You learn the /find familiar/ spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your
familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon,
quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your
own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack with its reaction.

**** Pact of the Blade
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: pact-of-the-blade
     :END:

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You
can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create
it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for
1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if
you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a
special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over
the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can
then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and
it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can't
affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases
being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a
different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to
it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional
space when the bond breaks.

**** Pact of the Tome
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: pact-of-the-tome
     :END:

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain
this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the
three needn't be from the same list). While the book is on your person,
you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count against your
number of cantrips known. If they don't appear on the warlock spell
list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to
receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed
during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
turns to ash when you die.

*** Ability Score Improvement
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: ability-score-improvement-10
    :END:

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Mystic Arcanum
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: mystic-arcanum
    :END:

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an
arcanum. Choose one 6th- level spell from the warlock spell list as this
arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You
must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can
be cast in this way: one 7th- level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level
spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain
all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.

*** Eldritch Master
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: eldritch-master
    :END:

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power
while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can
spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your
expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell
slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do
so again.

*** Eldritch Invocations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: eldritch-invocations-1
    :END:

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn
it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its
prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

/Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature/

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two
1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class's spell list
(the two needn't be from the same list). The spells appear in the book
and don't count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of
Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can't
cast the spells except as rituals, unless you've learned them by some
other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if
it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of
Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the
spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded
up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell. For each
level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50
gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of
other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike in their power.
Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and
invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively
freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other
patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each
other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz'Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils
such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and
balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can
use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower
planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare
landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it
previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is
not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific
experience.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a
long rest.

  *Your Pact Boon*

  Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that
  reflects your patron's nature.

  */Pact of the Chain/*. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical
  familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with
  sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits
  tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable,
  any familiar form is suitable for it.

  */Pact of the Blade/*. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon
  might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the
  Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned
  with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your
  weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in
  its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.

  */Pact of the Tome/*. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged
  tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the
  lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded
  with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden
  lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or
  it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with
  the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own
  burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.

*** Spellcasting
As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells
that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

**** Cantrips
At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard
spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard
table.

**** Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard
spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

**** Preparing and Casting Spells
The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to
cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook
equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one
spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and
two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of
prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level
spell /magic missile/, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level
slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your
spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to
cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

**** Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since
you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use
your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
one.

*Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier

*Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
modifier

**** Ritual Casting
You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the
spell prepared.

**** Spellcasting Focus
You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard
spells.

**** Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your
choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a
level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On
your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your
spellbook.

*** Arcane Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your
spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose
expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined
level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up),
and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two
levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell
slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

*** Arcane Tradition
When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your
practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration,
Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or
Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and
14th level.

*** Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

*** Spell Mastery
At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that
you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a
2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those
spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level,
you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells
you chose for different spells of the same levels.

*** Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and
can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in
your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells
prepared, they don't count against the number of spells you have
prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can't do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a
spell slot as normal.

** Arcane Traditions
The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal
discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds,
with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the
schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of
spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some
places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at
the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School
of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like
academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and
funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own
towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device,
since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

*** School of Evocation
You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects
such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling
lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use
their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own
gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

**** Evocation Savant
Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

**** Sculpt Spells
Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within
the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell
that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number
of them equal to 1 + the spell's level. The chosen creatures
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they
take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful
save.

**** Potent Cantrip
Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that
avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving
throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip's damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

**** Empowered Evocation
Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one
damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.

**** Overchannel
Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler
spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals
damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this
feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic
damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each
time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores
resistance and immunity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Your Spellbook*

  The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect
  the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
  breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You
  might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a
  spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or
  in a dusty tome in an ancient library.

  */Copying a Spell into the Book/*. When you find a wizard spell of 1st
  level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell
  level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and
  copy it.

  Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic
  form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used
  by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you
  understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into
  your spellbook using your own notation.

  For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50
  gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you
  experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you
  need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can
  prepare the spell just like your other spells.

  */Replacing the Book/*. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook
  into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of
  your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your
  spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own
  notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1
  hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.

  *If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to
  transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.
  Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new
  spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup
  spellbooks in a safe place.

  */The Book's Appearance/*. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of
  spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might
  be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from
  your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient
  library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after
  you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.
